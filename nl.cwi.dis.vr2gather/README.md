# VR2Gather - Unity application framework for immersive social VR

VR2Gather is an application framework to allow creating immersive social VR applications in Unity. Participants in a VR2Gather-based experience can be represented as live volumetric video, and see themselves as they are captured live, thereby allowing more realistic social interaction than in avatar-only based systems.

VR2Gather is open source, available from <https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2Gather>.

Documentation, including instructions on how to include and use VR2Gather in your Unity project, is available in the [project readme file](../README.md).
