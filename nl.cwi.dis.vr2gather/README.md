# VR2Gather - Unity package for immersive social VR

VR2Gather is a Unity package to allow creating immersive social VR applications in Unity. Participants in a VR2Gather-based experience can be represented as live volumetric video, and see themselves and each other as they are captured live, thereby allowing more realistic social interaction than in avatar-only based systems.

VR2Gather is open source, available from <https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2Gather>.

The full README is available at <https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2Gather/blob/master/README.md>.

It is important that you read that document before attempting to add VR2Gather to your project.
