# VR2Gather - Unity package for immersive social VR

VR2Gather is an Unity package to allow creating immersive social VR applications in Unity. Participants in a VR2Gather-based experience can be represented as live volumetric video, and see themselves as they are captured live, thereby allowing more realistic social interaction than in avatar-only based systems.

VR2Gather experiences do not rely on a central cloud-based game engine. Each participant runs a local copy of the application, and communication and synchronization is handled through a central experience-agnostic  _Orchestrator_ that handles forwarding of control messages, point cloud streams and conversational audio between the participants.

VR2Gather is a descendent from `VRTApplication` created in the [VRTogether](https://vrtogether.eu) project, and further developed in the [Mediascape XR](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/funding/mediascape/) and [Transmixr](https://transmixr.eu) projects. Current development is primarily done by the [CWI DIS group](https://www.dis.cwi.nl).

## Installing the VR2Gather package

VR2Gather requires Unity 2022.3.

VR2Gather requires a fair number of Unity packages and native packages. Almost all of these are either freely available through the Unity Package Manager, or available as open source.

Please read the [Installation guide](Documentation/02-installation.md).

We mean it: please read the [Installation guide](Documentation/02-installation.md). Also if you have used VR2Gather before. A lot of things have changed, and ensuring you have all the right bits and pieces installed, and you have done so in the right order, will save you a lot of headaches.

There is more documentation in [Documentation/01-overview.md](Documentation/01-overview.md) explaining how to develop your own VR experiences using VR2Gather.

## Developing on VR2Gather itself

If you want to make changes to VR2Gather you should check out this repository, <https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2Gather>. But really only then: otherwise just install the Unity package through the package manager (following the instructions above).

At the toplevel folder you will find the source of the Unity package, `nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather`.

You will also find 2 Unity projects:

- `VRTApp-Develop` is a pretty empty project that imports `nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather` by relative pathname. This has the advantage that as you make changes to any of the files from the package these changes will be made in-place, so you can then commit and push them later. There is also a trick with a symlink used to include the Samples into this project.
- `VRTApp-Sample` imports the package normally, i.e. using the github URL. So after you have made changes using VRTApp-Develop and pushed those changes you can open VRTApp-Sample, update the package, re-install the samples, and check that your changes actually work and have been pushed.

After making changes, and before pushing or testing with VRTApp-Sample you should _always_ change the package version number in `nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather/package.json`. Otherwise the Unity package manager will think that package has not changed and it will not re-import it.
