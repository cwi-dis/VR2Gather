# Placeholder for more pilots

This directory is a placeholder (and this readme file
to ensure the directory exists and gets a .meta and all that).

Checkout the right branch in VRTApplication, then dose something like

```
cd vrtapplication
git submodule add ssh://git@baltig.viaccess-orca.com:8022/VRT/tmp-group/vrtapp-cwi_cake.git Assets/PilotsExternal/CWI_cake
```

You may also have to add a reference to _xxxxxxx.cs_ and you make have to _xxxxxxxxx_ to include the scenes in the build.
