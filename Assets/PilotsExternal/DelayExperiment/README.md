Repository to be used as submodule for VRTApplication, for the delay experiments from Carlos.

To structure things the same as for the other submodule repositories:
- Don't put anything in this toplevel directory (except for this readme and the DelayExperiment directory.
- Put all you code, scripts, scenes, whatever into the DelayExperiment subdirectory.
- From the toplevel they will then appear to be in Assets/PilotsExternal/DelayExperiment/DelayExperiment.

This structure may not be the best but it is known to work with the other pilots.
