# VR2Gather - Developer overview

This documentation is intended to get you started with developing a VR2Gather experience. It consists of the following sections:

- [Installation](02-installation.md) explains what you need to install before you can get started, and how to include VR2Gather into your Unity project.
- [Walkthrough](03-walkthrough.md) gives a very high level overview of how the experience works at runtime, how the project is organized and how the various scenes, prefabs, assemblies, packages and scripts fit together.
- [Comparison to standard Unity practices](11-differences.md) is a quick overview of how the VR2Gather scene structure compare to the standard Unity XR scene structure.
- [Using Fish-net within VR2Gather](05-fishnet.md) preliminary documentation on using Fish-net to create networked objects.
- [Prefabs](04-prefabs.md) goes into the structure of the important prefabs and accompanying scripts.
- [Creating an experience](10-createnew.md) explains how to start creating a new experience with VR2Gather.
- [Building the experience](20-building.md) has some information on creating the built application.

Here is a walkthrough on how to port an existing pre-April-2024 VR2Gather experience to the new VR2Gather package: [Port a VRTApp to the package](31-port-to-package.md).

Here is a old overview (outdated) of how to create a VRTApp in the old structure: [outdated](30-new_submodule.md)

## Additional how-tos

There is documentation on how to record and playback a user during a session, which can be very useful for things like performance measurements under varying conditions: [record and playback](41-record-playback.md).
